## BIP breakthrough
True innovation of BIP “Bitcoin Improvement Proposal”.
Historically speaking, a monarchy can be extremely good or extremely bad depending on the person. That’s not sustainable.
democracy is better because it can self-correct but it doesn’t ensure merit and doesn’t guarantee the result can be better.
BIP introduces or put in practice the idea of meritocracy and democracy together. Never before we had such a thing.
You want to change the system for the better? Come with a really great idea and PROVE IT. Proved it?
Good, now everyone can discuss it. Everyone has a say. And we discuss it. If the change is good and it benefits everyone and it’s PROVEN (which democracy fails to do oftentimes) 
Then we will agree. And the change can take effect.
BIP insures only the best can get through
